    "With the gates opened, all the Uma\\nMusume are off to a clean start",

    "The other Uma Musume don't try to recklessly chase her, \\nand Silence Suzuka takes the lead",
    "Today she's also chosen to escape, \\nwe'll see what kind of result this leads to",
    "Hoooo~! Suzuka's really goin' hard!",
    "Not to win, but for her dreams- Just by carrying those \nfeelings, she looks like she's really enjoying it.",
    "Uwaa…! Suzuka-san!",
    "Silence Suzuka doesn't slow down as she continues\\nforward on the opposite end of the track",

    "What an amazingly high pace! \\nIs this her normal pace, or is she going too fast?!",

    "Suzuka-saaaaan!! Goooooooooooo!!",
    "Silence Suzuka passes the 200m mark! \\nLeaning on her speed, it seems she'll push through-!",
    "With ease! The leader, \nSilence Suzuka, crosses the goal!!",
    "Silence Suzuka, splendidly held the lead! \\nWhat a shocking way to end the race!"
