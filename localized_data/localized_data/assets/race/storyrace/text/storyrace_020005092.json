    "Kika Sho Uma Musume, Matikanefukukitaru is among the \nstrongest competitors as this 2000m battle unfolds!",
    "Among them is the favorite, with her overwhelming escape \nstyle, coming off her 3rd consectuive win, Silence \nSuzuka!",
    "With these veteran opponents, can she still make her \nescape?!",
    "Even though there's only a few of us, we're each top- \nclass, so even Suzuka-san should be proceeding carefully \nthrough this race…",
    "In which case, I should maintain this position!",
    "Silence Suzuka, enters the far side in the lead, \\nwith a spread of about 4 to 5 lengths.",
    "The second favorite, Matikanefukukitaru, \\nlooks to advance forward from the rear",
    "If we keep going at this pace, chasing is advantageous. \\nOn the last straight, with my strong finish then…!",
    "Silence Suzuka still doesn't lower her pace! \\nShe extends to an 8 or 9 length lead!",
    "Ueeeee?! Are you sane, Suzuka-san?!",
    "With this strong lead, \nSilence Suzuka rounds the third corner",
    "Even with this strong group of opponents, she chooses to \nescape! But her opponents are undaunted and continue to \napply pressure!",
    "But the distance between them doesn't close! \\nSilence Suzuka's speed doesn't drop!",
    "Silence Suzuka still has about a 5 length lead! \\nHer opponents enter their last spurt!",
    "Right here!",
    "From right here, in one go-",
    "Wha……?!",
    "Unbelieveable… Silence Suzuka, \\nthe frontrunner, enters another spurt!",
    "What an Uma Musume?! 8 Lengths, 9 lengths, she's pulling \nfarther and farther ahead!",
    "Incredible! Silence Suzuka with an easy victory!! With \nmore than 10 lengths difference — she crosses the goal!",
    "On this G2 stage, victory with such a large margin! \nSilence Suzuka, with her escape from \"Another \nDimension\"!"
