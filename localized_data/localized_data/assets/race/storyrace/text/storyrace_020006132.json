    "The stands are packed with fans at the Kyoto Racecourse",
    "Today's main race, the Spring Tenno Sho ―― Cheers \nerupt from the stands as the Uma Musume enter the first \nstraight!",
    "The one who takes the front is, the number 2 favorite, \nSeiun Sky! The champion, Mejiro Bright, settles in the \nmiddle of the pack",
    "And the favorite, Special Week, takes position slightly \nbehind Seiun Sky, she's chosen the Leading strategy!",
    "Don't you think Spe-chan's pulling too far foward……?",
    "No, up until now, Seiun Sky-san has had several races \nwhere she's managed to hold the lead all the way to \nthe end",
    "To prevent the opponent from creating their ideal race \\nprogression, this is the best position to take",
    "Spe's pretty good, huh?",
    "Looking good Bright, from that position",
    "You'll have no problems passing……!",
    "The race continues smoothly as they \\nenter the far side of the course",
    "Seiun Sky is out front, in the Kikka Sho it was right \naround here where she created some breathing room \nbetween the others",
    "But this time Special Week is right on her heels",
    "If she's marking me this closely, I guess \\nI can't run as freely as I'd like……",
    "That's fine, in that case",
    "I'll just win without the petty tricks!",
    "Now I just need to figure out the timing for my \\nspurt, the timing to pass Sei-chan, and also――",
    "The timing so that Bright-san can't catch me……!",
    "The Uma Musume round the final corner heading to \\nthe last straight! The rest of the pack picks up \\nthe pace! In an instant the race heats up!",
    "……！！",
    "She's making her move?!",
    "And here Special Week pushes forward! The frontrunner is \nSeiun Sky! From the outside comes Mejiro Bright!",
    "……！！",
    "As expected it's these 3! No more words need to \\nbe exchanged! With the Tenno Sho trophy on the \\nline, it's a battle on the final straight!",
    "Uwooooooooooo！！",
    "……！",
    "Seiun Sky enters her spurt! But it's Special \\nWeek! Special Week pulls ahead!",
    "Haaaaaaaa～！！！！",
    "In the lead is Special Week! Special Week \\nbegins to pull away from the pack!",
    "Bright……",
    "It's not that I want Bright to win……",
    "……！",
    "I want to win……",
    "Together, with Bright……！！",
    "Yaaaaaaaa～！！",
    "Bright from the outside! Here comes Mejiro Bright on the \noutside! With a strong push, she closes on Special Week!",
    "These are the legs of a champion! \\nIs this the end for Special Week！？",
    "Spe！？",
    "Spe-chan！！",
    "……！！",
    "I will live up to them…… to my Moms' hopes",
    "To everyone on the team's",
    "Hopes……！",
    "Right heeeeere～～！！",
    "What's this！？ Special Week enters another spurt！！ \nSpecial Week is in the lead！ Special Week remains in \nfront！",
    "Yaaaaaaa～～～～！！",
    "It's Special Week！！ Mejiro Bright is close behind, \\nbut she's unable to close the gap！",
    "Special Week, crosses the goal！！",
    "……",
    "Defeating the champion, Mejiro Bright",
    "Special Week",
    "Claims victory at the Tenno Sho！"
