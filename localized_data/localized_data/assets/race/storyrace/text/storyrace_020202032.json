    "With someone that good at starts next to her, \nit was always a possibility……",
    "The favorite being marked is unsurprising",
    "And――only those who are able to \novercome that can truly be called capable",
    "As they enter the far stretch, the pace settles",
    "Cesario is in the latter half, 3rd or 4th from last",
    "Air Messiah is far ahead of her in a good position \nmidfield",
    "My mother was one step short in the Oaks……",
    "Tasting regret, she knows just how precious the Tiara is",
    "And that feeling has transferred to me……",
    "My mother's dream became my dream, and still continues \non……!",
    "…………",
    "Maintaining the slow pace, \nthey enter the 3rd corner",
    "Cesario still maintains her position in the rear!",
    "Is this the correct decision!? ",
    "What should I do……?",
    "Right now, I have the option to choose the outside, \nbut……",
    "Should I take it?……So that I don't repeat the Oka Sho……",

    "Uwaaaaaaaaーーーー!!",
    "Carry on……",
    "Beyond the path I've run……",
    "To another evolution",
    "That leads to a new road……!",
